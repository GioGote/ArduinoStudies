# Gio's Arduino Studies

A repository meant to catalog and keep track of my (Gio Velasco's) learning and mastery of the Arduino Micro-Controller and C++ Programming Language.

Goal: Create a robot army for eventual world domination.

3/18/2025 - Understanding the mechanics of binary numbers within arduino's - 1's and 0's (study day).

3/20/2025 - Made a 4-bit binary counter that uses BITWISE ($) to check if an int corresponds to an LED binary. Only counts up to 15 since that is the max value allowed with only 4-bits.
